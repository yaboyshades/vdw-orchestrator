# Fixes Applied During Installation

## Summary
This document details all the fixes and implementations made to get the VDW Orchestrator running successfully.

## Files Created

### 1. `core/models.py`
**Issue**: Module was referenced but didn't exist  
**Solution**: Created complete Pydantic models including:
- `VDWPhase` enum with all phase states
- `ProjectContext` with full project state management
- `ToolMetadata` for MCP Box tool tracking
- `ToolCapability` for tool capability definitions
- `ReasoningQuery` and `ReasoningResponse` for Mangle integration

### 2. `core/state_machine.py`
**Issue**: Module was referenced but didn't exist  
**Solution**: Implemented VDWStateMachine with:
- Valid state transition mapping
- Transition validation logic
- Mangle client integration hooks
- Phase progression management

### 3. `reasoning/conversation_distiller.py`
**Issue**: Module was referenced but didn't exist  
**Solution**: Created ConversationDistiller with:
- Vibe-to-requirements transformation
- Segment parsing and structuring
- Dependency graph generation
- YAML output formatting
- Validation checklist generation

## Files Modified

### 1. `core/event_bus.py`
**Issue**: `aioredis` import error (duplicate TimeoutError base class)  
**Fix**: Changed `import aioredis` to `import redis.asyncio as aioredis`

### 2. `reasoning/mangle_client.py`
**Issue**: Missing protobuf generated files  
**Fix**: 
- Commented out gRPC imports
- Implemented stub version that returns mock responses
- Maintained interface compatibility for future integration

### 3. `core/api.py`
**Issue**: FastAPI dependency injection errors  
**Fix**:
- Added `Depends` import
- Added `response_model=None` to all endpoints
- Fixed dependency injection to use `lambda: main._orchestrator`
- Added proper type hints

### 4. `core/tools_api.py`
**Issue**: Same FastAPI dependency injection issues  
**Fix**:
- Added `Depends` import and `response_model=None`
- Fixed dependency injection to use `lambda: main._registry`
- Added `import main` for singleton access

### 5. `core/tools_gaps_api.py`
**Issue**: Same FastAPI dependency injection issues  
**Fix**:
- Added `Depends` import and `response_model=None`
- Fixed dependency injection to use `lambda: main._registry`

### 6. `main.py`
**Issue**: Router-level dependencies causing issues  
**Fix**: Removed `dependencies=[Depends(...)]` from router includes

### 7. `core/memory_store.py`
**Issue**: JSON serialization error with datetime objects  
**Fix**: Added custom JSON encoder to handle datetime serialization:
```python
def json_serial(obj):
    if isinstance(obj, datetime):
        return obj.isoformat()
    raise TypeError(f"Type {type(obj)} not serializable")
```

### 8. `core/tool_registry.py`
**Issue**: RuntimeError - no running event loop during initialization  
**Fix**: Removed `asyncio.create_task(self._initialize_database())` from `__init__`, added `_initialized` flag

### 9. `core/__init__.py`
**Issue**: Missing ToolCapability export  
**Fix**: Added `ToolCapability` to imports and `__all__` list

## Testing Infrastructure

### Created Files
1. `test_system.sh` - Comprehensive integration test script
2. `TEST_REPORT.md` - Detailed test results and system status
3. `FIXES_APPLIED.md` - This file

## System Configuration

### Services Started
- Redis server (daemonized on port 6379)
- FastAPI/Uvicorn server (port 8000)

### Data Directories Created
- `/home/ubuntu/vdw-orchestrator/data/memory/atoms/`
- `/home/ubuntu/vdw-orchestrator/data/memory/bonds.json`
- `/home/ubuntu/vdw-orchestrator/data/mcp_box.db` (prepared)

## Verification

All fixes were verified through:
1. Import testing: `python3.11 -c "import main"`
2. Server startup: Successfully started without errors
3. API testing: All tested endpoints working
4. Unit tests: Existing test passes
5. Integration tests: Full workflow from vibe to Phase 1 completion

## Notes

- The Mangle reasoning engine is currently in stub mode
- Only Phase 1 and 2 agents are implemented
- Full 5-phase workflow requires additional agent implementations
- Docker/Kubernetes deployment not tested
